          Front-end Web Developer with 15 years’ experience in the beauty and
          wellness industry. In my work as an aesthetician I was trained to see
          the details or the problem to create a solution. This skill set
          combined with my certificate in web development from the University of
          North Carolina will help me successfully create applications that are
          user-friendly. I have extensive knowledge in both front-end and
          back-end tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, MERN and PWAs.
        </p>

          I have experience working independently on projects as well as on a
          team. Successfully collaborated with a development team to create a
          JavaScript application that utilizes third party APIs to locate food
          and drink recipes based on the user’s preference. It is my growth
          mindset combined with strong leadership and collaborative skills that
          make me an advantageous candidate for any team.
